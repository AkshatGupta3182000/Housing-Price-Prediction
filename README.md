# Housing-Price-Prediction

built a model to predict median housing prices in California using the California cen‐
sus data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median hous‐
ing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest
geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block
group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).
